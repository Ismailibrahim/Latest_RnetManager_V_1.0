  ✅ BACKEND SERVER RESTARTED
========================================

The backend server has been restarted successfully!

Server Status:
  ✅ Running on: http://localhost:8000
  ✅ API Status: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
  ✅ Health Check: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

A new PowerShell window should have opened showing:
  "INFO  Server running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000]."

If you don't see the window, check if it's minimized
or running in the background.

========================================

The server now has the updated CORS configuration:
  - CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes http://localhost:3000
  - SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS includes localhost:3000
  - All settings are now active
