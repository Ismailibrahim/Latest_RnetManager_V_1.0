  FINAL MOBILE LOGIN FIX - SUMMARY
========================================

✅ WHAT I JUST FIXED:
========================================

1. ✅ Fixed frontend/.env.local
   - Changed API URL from localhost to: http://192.168.1.225:8000/api/v1
   - File is now correct!

2. ✅ Started backend with network access
   - Backend is now accessible from your phone
   - Use: start-backend-network.bat to start it in the future

========================================
⚠️ CRITICAL: RESTART FRONTEND NOW!
========================================

The frontend server MUST be restarted for the .env.local changes to work!

1. Stop current frontend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart:
   cd D:\Sandbox\Rent_V2\frontend
   npm run dev

========================================
TEST ON YOUR PHONE:
========================================

1. Make sure both servers are running:
   - Frontend: port 3000 (should show "Network: http://192.168.1.225:3000")
   - Backend: port 8000 (should be accessible from network)

2. On your phone, go to:
   http://192.168.1.225:3000

3. Try logging in

========================================
IF STILL NOT WORKING:
========================================

Check these:

1. Frontend server restarted? (MUST restart after .env.local change)
2. Backend running with --host=0.0.0.0? (Check with: netstat -ano | findstr :8000)
3. Firewall configured? (Run ALLOW-MOBILE-ACCESS.bat as Admin)
4. CORS errors? (Update backend .env with your IP)

========================================
QUICK COMMANDS:
========================================

Check servers:
  netstat -ano | findstr ":3000 :8000" | findstr LISTENING

Start backend (network):
  start-backend-network.bat

Find your IP:
  GET-MY-IP.bat

========================================
