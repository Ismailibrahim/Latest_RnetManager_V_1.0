  IMPORTANT: RESTART BACKEND SERVER
========================================

I just fixed the CORS configuration in your backend .env file.

The CORS settings now include port 3000 (where your frontend runs):
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1

⚠️ YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER FOR THIS CHANGE TO TAKE EFFECT!

Steps:
1. Go to the terminal window running "php artisan serve"
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
3. Run: php artisan serve (to start it again)

After restarting, refresh your frontend page - it should work!
